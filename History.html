    <h1>History of the Indo-European Language Family</h1>
      <h2>Origin and Spread</h2>
      <p>
         According to the Kurgan Hypothesis, the Indo-European language family is theorized to have originated from a common ancestor around 4500 to 2500 BCE. The speakers of PIE are thought to be the Yamnaya culture, Eurasian nomads who lived in the Pontic-Caspian steppe, which is suggested to be situated between Ukraine and southern Russia. It has also been evident that they had domesticated horses as a fast mode of transport. From there, they migrated and spread across Europe and parts of Asia, leading to the development of various branches of the Indo-European languages.

      <h2>The subdivisions</h2>
      <p>
         The Indo-European language family consists of several major branches, including Germanic, Romance, Slavic, Indo-Iranian, Celtic, Baltic, Hellenic (Greek), etc. It even has branches extinct in history, such as Anatolian and Tocharian. Nonetheless, it had yet to have international spread across continents due to colonial power. Even by then, each branch still had its own unique characteristics and has further diversified into numerous languages spoken today.
