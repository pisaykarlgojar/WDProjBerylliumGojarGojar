   <h1>Proto-Indo-European Language Tree</h1>
    <h2>P.I.E - History of the Indo-European Language Family</h2>
      <h2>Origin and Spread</h2>
      <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">
         According to the Kurgan Hypothesis, the Indo-European language family is theorized to have originated from a common ancestor around 4500 to 2500 BCE. The speakers of PIE are thought to be the Yamnaya culture, Eurasian nomads who lived in the Pontic-Caspian steppe, which is suggested to be situated between Ukraine and southern Russia. It has also been evident that they had domesticated horses as a fast mode of transport. From there, they migrated and spread across Europe and parts of Asia, leading to the development of various branches of the Indo-European languages.

    <div style="margin-bottom: 80px;">
      <h2>The subdivisions</h2>
      <p style="color: rgb(0, 26, 255)">
         The Indo-European language family consists of several major branches, including Germanic, Romance, Slavic, Indo-Iranian, Celtic, Baltic, Hellenic (Greek), etc. It even has branches extinct in history, such as Anatolian and Tocharian. Nonetheless, it had yet to have international spread across continents due to colonial power. Even by then, each branch still had its own unique characteristics and has further diversified into numerous languages spoken today.

      <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
      <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">
         This family tree has been crucial in understanding the historical connections between different cultures and civilizations. It has provided insights into ancient migrations, trade routes, and cultural exchanges that have shaped human history. And now with most of its descendants being the most prominent to be spoken by, it still plays a role in communication, such as within foreign political matters, a form of free societal speech, opportunity to negotiate on advancements in civilizations, and so on.

    <div style="margin-bottom: 80px;">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">
         The Indo-European language family is a testament to the interconnectedness of human societies throughout history. Its study continues to reveal fascinating insights into our shared linguistic heritage and the evolution of languages over millennia.
